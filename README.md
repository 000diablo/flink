# Apache Flink


Apache Flink is an open source system for expressive, declarative, fast, and efficient data analysis. Flink combines the scalability and programming flexibility of distributed MapReduce-like platforms with the efficiency, out-of-core execution, and query optimization capabilities found in parallel databases.

## Build Apache Flink From Source


### Requirements
* Unix-like environment (We use Linux, Mac OS X, Cygwin)
* git
* Maven (at least version 3.0.4)
* Java 6, 7 or 8 (Note that Oracle's JDK 6 library will fail to build Flink, but is able to run a pre-compiled package without problem)

```
git clone https://github.com/apache/incubator-flink.git
cd incubator-flink
mvn clean package -DskipTests # this will take up to 5 minutes
```

Flink is now installed in `flink-dist/target`

## Developing Flink

The Flink committers use the IntelliJ IDE and Eclipse to develop the Flink codebase.

Minimal requirements for an IDE are:
* Support for Java and Scala (also mixed projects)
* Support for Maven with Java and Scala


### IntelliJ

The IntelliJ IDE supports Maven out of the box and offers a plugin for Scala development.

* IntelliJ download: [https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)
* IntelliJ Scala Plugin: [http://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/?id=1347](http://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/?id=1347)

### Eclipse Scala IDE

For Eclipse users, we recommend using Scala IDE 3.0.3, based on Eclipse Kepler. While this is a slightly older version,
we found it to be the version that works most robustly for a complex project like Flink.

Further details, and a guide to newer Scala IDE versions can be found in the
[How to setup Eclipse](https://github.com/apache/flink/blob/master/docs/internal_setup_eclipse.md) docs.

**Note:** Before following this setup, make sure to run the build from the command line once
(`mvn clean package -DskipTests`, see above)

1. Download the Scala IDE (preferred) or install the plugin to Eclipse Kepler. See 
   [How to setup Eclipse](https://github.com/apache/flink/blob/master/docs/internal_setup_eclipse.md) for download links and instructions.
2. Add the "macroparadise" compiler plugin to the Scala compiler.
   Open "Window" -> "Preferences" -> "Scala" -> "Compiler" -> "Advanced" and put into the "Xplugin" field the path to
   the *macroparadise* jar file (typically "/home/*-your-user-*/.m2/repository/org/scalamacros/paradise_2.10.4/2.0.1/paradise_2.10.4-2.0.1.jar").
   Note: If you do not have the jar file, you probably did not run the command line build.
3. Import the Flink Maven projects ("File" -> "Import" -> "Maven" -> "Existing Maven Projects") 
4. During the import, Eclipse will ask to automatically install additional Maven build helper plugins.
5. Close the "flink-java8" project. Since Eclipse Kepler does not support Java 8, you cannot develop this project.

## About

Apache Flink is an effort undergoing incubation at The Apache Software Foundation (ASF), sponsored by the Apache Incubator PMC. Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects until a further review indicates that the infrastructure, communications, and decision making process have stabilized in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects. While incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or stability of the code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.

The Apache Flink project originated from the [Stratosphere](http://stratosphere.eu) research project.

CREATE statements are used to register a table/view/function into current or specified [Catalog]({{ site.baseurl }}/dev/table/catalogs.html). A registered table/view/function can be used in SQL queries.

Flink SQL supports the following CREATE statements for now:

- CREATE TABLE
- CREATE DATABASE

## Run a CREATE statement

CREATE statements can be executed with the `sqlUpdate()` method of the `TableEnvironment`, or executed in [SQL CLI]({{ site.baseurl }}/dev/table/sqlClient.html). The `sqlUpdate()` method returns nothing for a successful CREATE operation, otherwise will throw an exception.

The following examples show how to run a CREATE statement in `TableEnvironment` and in SQL CLI.

<div class="codetabs" markdown="1">
<div data-lang="java" markdown="1">
{% highlight java %}
EnvironmentSettings settings = EnvironmentSettings.newInstance()...
TableEnvironment tableEnv = TableEnvironment.create(settings);

// SQL query with a registered table
// register a table named "Orders"
tableEnv.sqlUpdate("CREATE TABLE Orders (`user` BIGINT, product STRING, amount INT) WITH (...)");
// run a SQL query on the Table and retrieve the result as a new Table
Table result = tableEnv.sqlQuery(
  "SELECT product, amount FROM Orders WHERE product LIKE '%Rubber%'");

// SQL update with a registered table
// register a TableSink
tableEnv.sqlUpdate("CREATE TABLE RubberOrders(product STRING, amount INT) WITH (...)");
// run a SQL update query on the Table and emit the result to the TableSink
tableEnv.sqlUpdate(
  "INSERT INTO RubberOrders SELECT product, amount FROM Orders WHERE product LIKE '%Rubber%'");
{% endhighlight %}

# SQL query with a registered table

## CREATE TABLE

{% highlight sql %}
CREATE TABLE [catalog_name.][db_name.]table_name
  [(col_name1 col_type1 [COMMENT col_comment1], ...)]
  [COMMENT table_comment]
  [PARTITIONED BY (col_name1, col_name2, ...)]
  WITH (key1=val1, key2=val2, ...)
{% endhighlight %}

Creates a table with the given name. If a table with the same name already exists in the catalog, an exception is thrown.

**PARTITIONED BY**

Partition the created table by the specified columns. A directory is created for each partition if this table is used as a filesystem sink.

**WITH OPTIONS**

Table properties used to create a table source/sink. The properties are usually used to find and create the underlying connector.

The key and value of expression `key1=val1` should both be string literal. See details in [Connect to External Systems]({{ site.baseurl }}/dev/table/connect.html) for all the supported table properties of different connectors.

**Notes:** The table name can be of three formats: 1. `catalog_name.db_name.table_name` 2. `db_name.table_name` 3. `table_name`. For `catalog_name.db_name.table_name`, the table would be registered into metastore with catalog named "catalog_name" and database named "db_name"; for `db_name.table_name`, the table would be registered into the current catalog of the execution table environment and database named "db_name"; for `table_name`, the table would be registered into the current catalog and database of the execution table environment.

**Notes:** The table registered with `CREATE TABLE` statement can be used as both table source and table sink, we can not decide if it is used as a source or sink until it is referenced in the DMLs.

## CREATE DATABASE

{% highlight sql %}
CREATE DATABASE [IF NOT EXISTS] [catalog_name.]db_name
  [COMMENT database_comment]
  WITH (key1=val1, key2=val2, ...)
{% endhighlight %}

Create a database with the given database properties. If a database with the same name already exists in the catalog, an exception is thrown.

**IF NOT EXISTS**

If the database already exists, nothing happens.

**WITH OPTIONS**

Database properties used to store extra information related to this database.
The key and value of expression `key1=val1` should both be string literal.
